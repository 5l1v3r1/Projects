# Projects

Backyard Brains hosts experiment development projects throughout the year. Some of these turn into our experiments, some of these are for our own intellectual curiosity, and some turn into publications in peer reviewed journals. Here you will find each project which contains our open-source schematics, docs, and code.

The projects are:

 * Songbird - A device that can collect environmental and geo-positioning data while detecting and identifying birdsongs automatically.
